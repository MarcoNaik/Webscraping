    "text": "PRE-ORDER NOW AND GET EARLY ACCESS!LOS ANGELES, CA – March 5, 2021 – With a continued dedication to elevate the world of gaming, professional esports, and interactive entertainment, Tempo Storm today announced its official partnership with Republic to generate funding through a new wave of inclusive public investing. Aiming to unleash the full potential of gamers and creators through interactive and immersive storytelling, Tempo’s new partnership with the investment platform will raise funds to support the brand’s developing initiatives for its first original game, The Bazaar. This news comes on the heels of Tempo’s last funding announcement from February when the organization confirmed it raised $3.3M led by Galaxy Interactive’s EOS VC Fund.With a proven track record of successful and interactive investing for innovative companies such as aerospace startup SpaceX and stock trading app Robinhood, Republic is an investing platform that allows anyone—regardless of income or net worth—to invest in startups spanning the tech, gaming, crypto and real estate sectors.Tempo's Chief Revenue Officer Noah Kline commented the following:“Republic offers us that rare opportunity to connect deeper with the Tempo community—from industry professionals to the fans of our brand. This is a real opportunity to give our fans and investors in our network a chance to own a tangible stake in not just Tempo as a company, but the future of interactive entertainment.”The funds raised over the course of the campaign will be primarily used to continue building The Bazaar, Tempo’s first original game. With design led by Tempo Founder and CEO Andrey Yanyuk (“reynad”) after years of experience as a professional card-game player, the digital strategy game is set in an intergalactic marketplace where players go head-to-head in a strategic battle to take down their opponent. The Bazaar is scheduled to launch in mid-2021. Additional funds will be distributed among the company’s other sectors, including Tempo’s streaming division, Tempo’s production division, and the Tempo Community.Since its founding in 2014, Tempo has proven itself to be one of the most successful esports organizations in the world across multiple competitive gaming titles. Tempo Storm has owned teams in popular games including Hearthstone, Magic: The Gathering, PUBG Mobile, Super Smash Bros., and more. With the aim of growing far beyond the confines of the traditional esports organization, Tempo continues to push further into interactive and immersive media, transforming the brand into something unlike anything else in esports—or in video games as a whole.For more information on Tempo, head to the organization’s official website here, or visit Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitch.Powered by Shopify\n    Main menu\n  \n    Info\n  Sign up and saveSubscribe to get special offers, free giveaways, and once-in-a-lifetime deals.Powered by Shopify",

During original crowdfunding, those who contributed at the $1,000 tier earned a card design session with reynad, being able to cement their idea into The Bazaar and ensure their card would make it into the final version of the game.One thing we had to consider is that we did not want to devalue the personalized, unique experience that prior card design session redeemers received; as a result, we decided not to make that a freely purchasable option – at least for now.However, reynad was willing to do one more card design session that would be randomly raffled away to a supporter of The Bazaar!Check out the embedded giveaway below to find out how you can get a shot at adding your dream card to The Bazaar!

    "text": "Your cart is currently empty.PRE-ORDER NOW AND GET EARLY ACCESS!Last week, we announced the relaunch of The Bazaar pre-orders, and the response was incredible! We want to thank everyone for your support – it's heartwarming to see The Bazaar Discord community growing so quickly, with all the members getting along so well.As you might have expected, we received a lot of inquiries about the pre-orders, so we compiled a list of the most frequently asked questions and are going to answer them today:If I already backed the Indiegogo campaign, can I still pre-order through PlayTheBazaar.com?Yes! By pre-ordering on PlayTheBazaar.com, you will receive more in-game currency, the official The Bazaar t-shirt, and early access to The Bazaar, all on top of everything you already received from your Indiegogo pledge.Which Indiegogo pledges included early access?All pledges of $25 and up during the Indiegogo campaign included early access to The Bazaar (the $5 pledge did not include early access to the game). By pre-ordering with $20 or more on PlayTheBazaar.com, you will guarantee early access to The Bazaar, even if you did not pledge more than $25 on Indiegogo.What is the difference in benefits among the $20, $50, $75, $100, and $250 pre-order options?The key difference between the tiers is the amount of in-game currency you will receive. During our special \"double your money\" offer, contributing those amounts will earn you $40, $100, $150, $200, and $500 of in-game currency, respectively.Beyond that, all five tiers come with early access to The Bazaar. The $100 and $250 tiers also come with a physical reward – we will ship an exclusive The Bazaar t-shirt straight to your door!For how long will the pre-order be available?The ability to pre-order The Bazaar will be available until the game's beta version is released. However, the special offer for doubling your in-game currency will likely end before then.When does early access begin?There is no set date yet for The Bazaar early access. The best estimate we have is approximately one year from now, but it could end up being sooner or later. Be sure to stay tuned to our development updates for the latest news on early access!Is the t-shirt you get with the $100+ pre-order on PlayTheBazaar.com the same t-shirt as the one offered during the Indiegogo campaign?Yes.Is the game going to be free-to-play (F2P)?Yes! Every player will start the game with a few classes unlocked – this means they will have access to all the cards available to those classes.You might then be asking, where does the pre-order and in-game currency come in? As more classes get introduced to the game, you will have the option of unlocking them with in-game currency or real-world money.In addition, the game board itself will also be customizable with themes and contraptions, and all cards will have golden or alternate art versions. Most of the game's revenue will come from cosmetic effects that do not affect actual gameplay success.Will the game be available on PC, Mac, mobile, Steam, etc.?Cross-platform compatibility is a priority and should be expected for The Bazaar. We will have more specific details available in future development updates!Do you have any other questions not answered in this FAQ?

    "text": "PRE-ORDER NOW AND GET EARLY ACCESS!Our Indiegogo campaign was a limited-time offer to show your interest in The Bazaar, pre-order some in-game currency, redeem some physical perks, and help fund the development of the game. Ever since the conclusion of the campaign, we've been getting endless messages asking us to bring back pre-orders.Today, we're excited to announce the relaunch of The Bazaar pre-orders!Now is your second (and possibly final) chance to be an original part of The Bazaar's development process and help turn the game into reality. We have pre-order tiers ranging from $20 to $250, with all orders over $100 receiving an exclusive The Bazaar t-shirt.All pre-order money will go straight into funding the game's development, letting us pay our software engineering bills faster and expediting the launch of the game. On top of that, you'll be able to cash out after the release of The Bazaar by getting double your contributions back in in-game currency!Along with the relaunch of pre-orders, we set up an official The Bazaar Discord server in case you have any questions or feedback, or simply just want to share the hype with other fans.

You might know me as a professional card player, streamer extraordinaire, or as the founder of the esports franchise Tempo Storm.Fundamentally, I am a lifelong gamer, but what people might not know is that I am a lifelong game designer. I grew up playing card games, and even as a kid, I designed my own games at home using simple programming languages. As I found broader success in the past years in esports, I’ve never lost the desire to create a new game—to put my ideas on paper and bring something new to this industry that I love.So about a year ago, I realized, why don’t we make our own card game? With my passion for card games and deckbuilding, plus our amazing staff and network in the industry, we’re in an incredible position to design a card game with a deckbuilding focus that plays and feels totally different from what people have been able to get their hands on.So I’ve actually been designing a PC and mobile card game behind the scenes.Powered by Shopify\n    Main menu\n  \n    Info\n  Sign up and saveSubscribe to get special offers, free giveaways, and once-in-a-lifetime deals.Powered by Shopify",
